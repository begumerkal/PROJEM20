Clash of Balls is an Android multiplayer game. Each player controls a ball and
tries to push the others down into the black nirvana.

It uses the AllJoyn (Apache license) library for peer-to-peer communication. So
no server is used, but each player needs to be in the same network to see each
other. If the device supports it, Clash of Balls should also run via Bluetooth.

For physics simulation, JBox2D is used, a Java implementation of the 2D physics
engine Box2D. It uses the zlib license.


Usage
-----

The game should be self-explanatory, there is a Help Menu. When the game starts
and the countdown is shown, hold your device still in a desired position, where
your ball should not move. During the game, tilt the device to move your player
to a certain direction.


Levels
------

The levels are in the folder res/raw/. The class GameLevel describes how to
create a new level. This can then be added in LevelManager.loadLevels().


Debugging & Settings
--------------------

To facilitate debugging, set GameSettings.debug to true. This allows the game to
be startet on a single phone.
In GameSettings also other settings can be set to control the behaviour of the
game.


Miscellaneous
-------------
