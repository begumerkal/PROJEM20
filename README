Clash of Balls is an Android multiplayer game. Each player controls a ball and
tries to push the others down into the black nirvana.

It uses the AllJoyn (Apache license) library for peer-to-peer communication. So
no server is used, but each player needs to be in the same network to see each
other. If the device supports it, Clash of Balls should also run via Bluetooth.

For physics simulation, JBox2D is used, a Java implementation of the 2D physics
engine Box2D. It uses the zlib license.


Usage
-----

The aim of the game is to bounce the other players out of the field by balancing
your device.The game should be self-explanatory, there is a Help Menu. When the 
game starts and the countdown is shown, hold your device still in the desired 
position, where your ball should not move. During the game, tilt the device to 
move your player to a certain direction.


Levels
------

The levels are in the folder res/raw/. The class GameLevel describes how to
create a new level. This can then be added in LevelManager.loadLevels().


Debugging & Settings
--------------------

To facilitate debugging, set GameSettings.debug to true. This allows the game to
be startet on a single phone.
In GameSettings also other settings can be set to control the behaviour of the
game.


Code
----

- network protocol
  whenever the network protocol changes, make sure to increase
  Networking.protocol_version. This will prevent clients with different protocol
  versions to connect to each other.


Miscellaneous
-------------
